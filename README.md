## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Gabriel Oliveira Sant'ana, i live in Brazil, i'm 25 years old, i'm a self taught developer who mainly uses Python to build Software (UI,Backend and Database manipulation), it all started in my first two years of Control and automation engeniring that was in IFES - Campus Serra, where i was introduced to programming, studying algorithms and data structure in C and next i was shown Python and Object oriented programming, now i've switched from engenering to a course called "Tecnologia em sistemas para internet" or in a "raw" translation, technology in systems for the internet, which is also in IFES - Campus Serra, i am mostly programming for myself or build apps for the company i work on nowdays, in which my role is not as a developer, i'm a Blast furnace operator, but i build apps as a hobbie, something that makes me feel good, i considere myself as a python fullstack amateur developer, since i build all parts of my project.

I want to keep getting better at what i do, i'm currently learning Flet, a Python framework to build User interface, working to be more proficient in OOP and using git/Github as a remote repository to make my projects more organized, my goal is to become a professional developer in the near future!
